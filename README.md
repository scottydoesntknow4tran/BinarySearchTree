# BinarySearchTree
This program creates an integer binary search tress using 30 random numbers between 0 and 100
If a number is repeated then it is labled as a repeat and not added to the tree again
The program then preforms an in-order traversal printing the nodes and their memory locations
The program then finds 5 random nodes on the tree to "delete"
